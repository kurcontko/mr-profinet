# Mr. PROFINET
A PROFINET devices network scanner, developed in LabVIEW.

## Overview
Mr. PROFINET is a powerful and easy-to-use network scanning tool designed to detect PROFINET devices in your network. The program is built in LabVIEW and utilizes a C .dll to implement Raw Sockets with Winpcap.

The application employs a simple Finite State Machine (FSM) to scan and analyze PROFINET-DCP frames, helping you identify devices and monitor your PROFINET network fast and easy.

## Features
Scans PROFINET devices in your network
Utilizes Raw Sockets with Winpcap for efficient and accurate scanning
Simple and straightforward FSM for scanning PROFINET-DCP frames
